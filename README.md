# 🏥 Hospital Readmission Prediction

## 📋 Project Overview
This machine learning project predicts which diabetic patients are likely to be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days. The model identifies high-risk patients enabling healthcare providers to implement targeted interventions, reduce readmission rates, and improve patient outcomes.

**🎯 Business Problem**: Hospital readmissions cost billions annually and often indicate gaps in care transition. This project provides a data-driven solution for proactive patient management.

**🤖 ML Task**: Binary classification predicting 30-day readmissions with excellent accuracy and interpretability.

## 📊 Key Results

### Model Performance
